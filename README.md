# Article Recommender

This tutorial demonstrates how to use Pinecone's similarity search to create a simple personalized article or content recommender.

The goal is to create a recommendation engine that retrieves the best article recommendations for each user. When making recommendations with content-based filtering, we evaluate the user’s past behavior and the content items themselves. So in this example, users will be recommended articles that are similar to those they've already read.

```bash
npm install
```

## Required configuration

In order to run this example, you have to supply the Pinecone credentials needed to interact with the Pinecone API. You can find these credentials in the [Pinecone web console](https://app.pinecone.io) under **API Keys**. This project uses `dotenv` to easily load values from the `.env` file into the environment when executing.

Copy the template file:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

And fill in your API key and index name:

```sh
PINECONE_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
PINECONE_INDEX="article-recommendations"
PINECONE_CLOUD="aws"
PINECONE_REGION="us-west-2"
```

`PINECONE_INDEX` is the name of the index where this demo will store and query embeddings. You can change `PINECONE_INDEX` to any name you like, but make sure the name not going to collide with any indexes you are already using.

`PINECONE_CLOUD` and `PINECONE_REGION` define where the index should be deployed. Currently, this is the only available cloud and region combination (`aws` and `us-west-2`), so it's recommended to leave them defaulted.

## Data preparation

Next, we will prepare data for the Pinecone vector index, and insert it in batches.

The [dataset](https://components.one/datasets/all-the-news-2-news-articles-dataset/) used throughout this example contains 2.7 million news articles and essays from 27 American publications.

Let's download the dataset.

```bash
wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/cn2utnr5ipathhh/all-the-news-2-1.zip -q --show-progress
unzip -q all-the-news-2-1.zip
mkdir data
mv all-the-news-2-1.csv data/.
```

## Create Vector embeddings

To load data into our index, we need to create embeddings and upsert records into Pinecone. Run `npm run index` to do that in this project.

Since the dataset could be pretty big, this project uses a generator function that will yield chunks of data to be processed.

```typescript
async function* processInChunks<T, M extends keyof T, P extends keyof T>(
  dataFrame: dfd.DataFrame,
  chunkSize: number,
  metadataFields: M[],
  pageContentField: P
): AsyncGenerator<Document[]> {
  for (let i = 0; i < dataFrame.shape[0]; i += chunkSize) {
    const chunk = await getChunk(dataFrame, i, chunkSize);
    const records = dfd.toJSON(chunk) as T[];
    yield records.map((record: T) => {
      const metadata: Partial<Record<M, T[M]>> = {};
      for (const field of metadataFields) {
        metadata[field] = record[field];
      }
      return new Document({
        pageContent: record[pageContentField] as string,
        metadata,
      });
    });
  }
}
```

For each chunk, the function generates an array of `Document` objects. The function is defined with three type parameters: `T`, `M`, and `P`.

Here are the parameters the function accepts:

- `dataFrame`: This is the DataFrame that the function will process.
- `chunkSize`: This is the number of records that will be processed in each chunk.
- `metadataFields`: This is an array of field names (which are keys of `T`) to be included in the metadata of each `Document`.
- `pageContentField`: This is the field name (which is a key of `T`) to be used for the page content of each `Document`.

Here's what the function does:

1. It loops over the DataFrame in chunks of size `chunkSize`.
2. For each chunk, it converts the chunk to JSON to get an array of records (of type `T`).
3. Then, for each record in the chunk, it:
   - Creates a `metadata` object that includes the specified metadata fields from the record.
   - Creates a new `Document` with the `pageContent` from the specified field in the record, and the `metadata` object.
4. It then yields an array of the created `Document` objects for the chunk.

The `yield` keyword is used here to produce a value from the generator function. This allows the function to produce a sequence of values over time, rather than computing them all at once and returning them in a single array.

Next we'll create a function that will generate the embeddings and upsert them into Pinecone. We'll use the `processInChunks` generator function to process the data in chunks. We'll also use the `chunkedUpsert` method to insert the embeddings into Pinecone in batches.

```typescript
async function embedAndUpsert(dataFrame: dfd.DataFrame, chunkSize: number) {
  const chunkGenerator = processInChunks<
    ArticleRecord,
    "section" | "url" | "title" | "publication" | "author" | "article",
    "article"
  >(
    dataFrame,
    100,
    ["section", "url", "title", "publication", "author", "article"],
    "article"
  );
  const index = pinecone.index(indexName);

  for await (const documents of chunkGenerator) {
    await embedder.embedBatch(
      documents,
      chunkSize,
      async (embeddings: PineconeRecord[]) => {
        await chunkedUpsert(index, embeddings, "default");
        progressBar.increment(embeddings.length);
      }
    );
  }
}
```

We'll use the `splitFile` utility function to split the CSV file we downloaded into chunks of 100k parts each. For the purposes of this example, we'll only use the first 100k records.

```typescript
const fileParts = await splitFile("./data/all-the-news-2-1.csv", 100000);
const firstFile = fileParts[0];
```

Next, we'll load the data into a DataFrame using `loadCSVFile` and to simplify things, we'll also drop all rows which include a null value.

```typescript
const data = await loadCSVFile(firstFile);
const clean = data.dropNa() as dfd.DataFrame;
```

Now we'll create the Pinecone index and kick off the embedding and upserting process.

```typescript
// Create the index if it doesn't already exist
const indexList = await pinecone.listIndexes();
if (!indexList.indexes?.some((index) => index.name === indexName)) {
  await pinecone.createIndex({
    name: indexName,
    dimension: 384,
    spec: { serverless: { region: indexRegion, cloud: indexCloud } },
    waitUntilReady: true,
  });
}

progressBar.start(clean.shape[0], 0);
await embedder.init("Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2");
await embedAndUpsert(clean, 1);
progressBar.stop();
```

## Query the Pinecone Index

We will query the index for the an imagined user. We'll simulate a set of the articles that the user previously read. Based on the article embeddings, we will define a unique embedding for the user.

```typescript
const indexName = getEnv("PINECONE_INDEX");
const pinecone = new Pinecone();

// Ensure the index exists
try {
  const description = await pinecone.describeIndex(indexName);
  if (!description.status?.ready) {
    throw new Error(
      `Index not ready, description was ${JSON.stringify(description)}`
    );
  }
} catch (e) {
  console.log(
    'An error occurred. Run "npm run index" to load data into the index before querying.'
  );
  throw e;
}

const index = pinecone.index<ArticleRecord>(indexName).namespace("default");

await embedder.init("Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2");

const { query, section } = getQueryingCommandLineArguments();
```


# This is What I need
```typescript
// We create a simulated user with an interest given a query and a specific section
const queryEmbedding = await embedder.embed(query);
const queryResult = await index.query({
  vector: queryEmbedding.values,
  includeMetadata: true,
  includeValues: true,
  filter: {
    section: { $eq: section },
  },
  topK: 10,
});
```


We'll calculate the **mean** vector given the results of the query. The mean vector represents the user's interests based on the articles they've read.

```typescript
// We extract the vectors of the results
const userVectors = queryResult?.matches?.map(
  (result: ScoredPineconeRecord<ArticleRecord>) => result.values
);

// A couple of functions to calculate mean vector
const mean = (arr: number[]): number =>
  arr.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) / arr.length;
const meanVector = (vectors: number[][]): number[] => {
  const { length } = vectors[0];

  return Array.from({ length }).map((_, i) =>
    mean(vectors.map((vec) => vec[i]))
  );
};

// We calculate the mean vector of the results
// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-non-null-assertion
const meanVec = meanVector(userVectors!);
```

To resolve the recommendations, we'll query the index with the mean vector and filter out the articles that the user has already read.

```typescript
const recommendations = await index.query({
  vector: meanVec,
  includeMetadata: true,
  includeValues: true,
  topK: 10,
});
```

Finally, we'll use `console-table-printer` to print out the recommendations.

```typescript
const userPreferences = new Table({
  columns: [
    { name: "title", alignment: "left" },
    { name: "author", alignment: "left" },
    { name: "section", alignment: "left" },
  ],
});

const userRecommendations = new Table({
  columns: [
    { name: "title", alignment: "left" },
    { name: "author", alignment: "left" },
    { name: "section", alignment: "left" },
  ],
});

queryResult?.matches?.slice(0, 10).forEach((result: any) => {
  const { title, article, publication, section } = result.metadata;
  userPreferences.addRow({
    title,
    article: `${article.slice(0, 70)}...`,
    publication,
    section,
  });
});

console.log("========== User Preferences ==========");
userPreferences.printTable();

recommendations?.matches?.slice(0, 10).forEach((result: any) => {
  const { title, article, publication, section } = result.metadata;
  userRecommendations.addRow({
    title,
    article: `${article.slice(0, 70)}...`,
    publication,
    section,
  });
});
console.log("=========== Recommendations ==========");
userRecommendations.printTable();
```

## Query Results

We can see that each user's recommendations have a high similarity to what the user actually reads. A user who likes Tennis news has plenty of Tennis news recommendations. A user who likes to read about Xbox has that kind of news. And a business user has plenty of Wall Street news that they enjoy.

Since we used only the title and the content of the article to define the embeddings, and we did not take publications and sections into account, a user may get recommendations from a publication/section that they does not regularly read. You may try adding this information when creating embeddings as well and check your query results then!

Also, you may notice that some articles appear in the recommendations, although the user has already read them. These articles could be removed as part of postprocessing the query results, in case you prefer not to see them in the recommendations.
